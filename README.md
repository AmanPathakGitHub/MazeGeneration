# Usage
To clone this repository,  use the --recursive flag to install sdl2 aswell
    
    git clone https://github.com/AmanPathakGitHub/MazeGeneration.git --recursive

By going to **includes/globals.h** you can change the window size and the cell size to create different sized mazes. 

Once you have changed the desired settings create the executable using cmake and run the .exe file in the bin directory.

A maze will automatically generate on startup and pressing any key will create a new maze
